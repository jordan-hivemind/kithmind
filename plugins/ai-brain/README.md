# AI Brain

Personal AI memory layer for Claude Code. Captures thoughts across sessions, syncs project context, and synthesizes what you've learned — with citable sources.

## What it does

AI Brain is a thin Claude Code plugin over a hosted MCP server. The server stores your thoughts, people, projects, and insights; the plugin exposes skills that let Claude read and write that store as part of your workflow.

The server asks compatible AI clients to capture precise durable facts through
typed entity relationships and coherent narrative memories separately.
Captures are deduplicated. When something changes, the new current fact or
memory is linked to the former record, which remains available as explicit
history rather than being overwritten.
For relevant prompts, the server also asks the client to recall a small core
memory set plus query-specific current context before answering. Both behaviors
remain client-mediated: the server cannot see a conversation unless the client
calls a tool.

### Five skills

- **`/brain-init`** — Preview-first onboarding. Discovers available sources, excludes incidental or inferred noise, and proposes at most 15 atomic facts/memories for approval before writing anything.
- **`/brain-sync`** — Sync the current project's context into the brain. Compares against existing thoughts via progressive disclosure and only captures new or changed info.
- **`/weekly-review`** — Weekly synthesis cross-referencing thoughts, workflow insights (if `radar` is installed), and goals. Every claim cites its source.
- **`/brain-thread <topic>`** — Reconstruct the evolution of your thinking on a topic. Walks the chronological neighbors around a seed thought.
- **`/brain-context <date>`** — Restore what was on your mind at a specific moment. Anchors on a date or event-like phrase.

### One hook

- **SessionStart:** Checks if your brain is empty and nudges you to `/brain-init` if so. Silent otherwise.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add flippyhead/ai-brain-plugin
/plugin install ai-brain@ai-brain-plugin
```

## Requirements

- Claude Code or compatible MCP client
- An AI Brain server account (hosted at https://ai-brain-pi.vercel.app)

### Authentication (optional)

If your brain is protected by an API key, set one of:

- `AI_BRAIN_TOKEN`
- `AI_BRAIN_API_KEY`
- `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`

Or pass an explicit auth header via `AI_BRAIN_AUTHORIZATION` / `MCP_AUTHORIZATION`.

## Tips for getting the most out of it

- **Cite sources in responses.** When you ask Claude a question grounded in your brain, expect answers with `fact:<id>`, `thought:<id>`, or `insight:<id>` citations.
- **Use `/brain-sync` when switching projects.** It only captures what's actually new, so running it every few days keeps the brain current without bloating it.
- **Use `/brain-thread` for retrospectives.** When a decision didn't go the way you hoped, trace the thread back to see what you were optimizing for.
- **Use `/brain-context` when returning from a break.** The brief restores ambient context — who you were working with, what was in flight — in under a minute.
- **Ask historical questions naturally.** Search defaults to current memories; the plugin can include superseded or corrected memories when you ask what used to be true or how something changed.
- **Mark core context sparingly.** Core memories are always considered during grounded recall, so reserve them for durable identity, relationship, preference, and active-project facts.

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin shows no skills after install.** Run `/plugin` to confirm `ai-brain` is listed and enabled. If not, reinstall via the command above.

**"MCP tools not available" errors.** Check that `mcp__ai-brain__*` tools appear in `/mcp`. If the server is reachable via curl but tools aren't listed, try `/mcp reload`.

**SessionStart hook doesn't nudge on empty brain.** The hook silently exits on network errors (timeout, auth failure). Run the script directly to debug:

```
node ~/.claude/plugins/cache/ai-brain-plugin/*/hooks/check-brain-status.mjs
```

**Want to see what's in your brain without a skill?** Use `/mcp` to find the `ai-brain` server, then invoke `get_stats` or `browse_recent` directly.
